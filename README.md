# Hello World | Solid App | Proof-of-Concept

Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate how a user can log in to their Solid pod.

## Install

The most common JS libraries to build Solid Apps in are maintained by Inrupt:

- `@inrupt/solid-client` A client library for accessing data stored in Solid Pods.
- `@inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser` A client library for authenticating to Solid identity servers in a browser.

These and other dependencies can be installed with NPM or Yarn.

This POC followed the "Getting Started" instructions from the [Inrupt JavaScript Client Libraries](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/) documentation.

As the examples use Webpack, so does this project.

## Usage
